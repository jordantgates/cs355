For Lab #5, you will need to implement your own matrices and vectors, including multiplying matrices together.  

Here is Java code for multiplying two matrices:

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
   for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
         C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
Matrix times vector multiplication is similar, just drop the j loop and the [j] secondary index.
